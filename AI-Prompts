- For the VOL_PIN - when rebooting the ESP32, sometime you need to turn the potentiometer clockwise to turn up the volume, other times you need to turn it any-clockwise. Some suggested that instead of relying only on the basic analogRead(), you should explicitly configure the specific ADC unit (ADC1 or ADC2) and its attenuation. This ensures a consistent setup on every boot.
   
- Instead of press-buttons, can we use the Touch Screen interface instead to change settings releasing the relevant GPIO Pins for the TFT screen. I have big fingers so don't make the buttons too small

- All settings which can be changed on the TFT screen.  The Webportal should also availabe as a WiFi access point to configure the WiFi Access credentials

- Can you update the time logic to use the ezTime library so we automatically get the correct time zone and are aware of Daylight Savings time. If we are in a country with Day Light Savings time - we need to ensure that the time changes at the correct moment so I guess we have to keep checking this every minute? Also update the DisplayI9341 logic so it displays the digital clock in the format DDD, DD MMM YYYY HH:MM using the data from this ezTime library and if there is no Alarm set, hide the "ALARM: OFF". This module also doesn't clear the digital clock properly so you can see bits of the previous time on the screen. Fix that as well.

- Using the attached Config.h file - this file contains MODE_SWITCH_PIN. This project contains 2 MAX98357A amplifiers connected to two speakers, these speakers can play sound from the I2S stream from the ESP32 or a radio stations from the connected SI4735-D60-GU. The MODE_SWITCH_PIN is used to select between these audio sources through the CD74HCT4053M96 component. Can you describe the preferred schematics and write a small arduino sketch to implement this switching logic.

- I'm now moving on to the Si4735-D60. I have the SSOP package. I believe it has two output types: analogue and digitial. Given I'm using the CD74HCT4053M96 to switch - I assume I have to use the digital one. A few questions to start off with: what do I do with pin 23 and 24 which I believe are only used for analogue? Also pin 17 is labelled as SCLK. In the digital mode, I believe we can not use the external Crystal and need to use the SCLK to get the clock signal from the ESP32. But pin 17 is also the I2C SCL pin. How dow connect this all up together so the chip uses I2C and can be switched tthrough the CD74HCT4053M96

But your previous recommendation was to use the CD74HCT4053M96 to switch LRC; BCLK; and DIN/DOUT between the Si4735 and the I2S signal being streamed from a different audio source generated in ESP32. I would like to stick to that principle if possible
