-------------------
- For the VOL_PIN - when rebooting the ESP32, sometime you need to turn the potentiometer clockwise to turn up the volume, other times you need to turn it any-clockwise. Some suggested that instead of relying only on the basic analogRead(), you should explicitly configure the specific ADC unit (ADC1 or ADC2) and its attenuation. This ensures a consistent setup on every boot.
   
- Instead of press-buttons, can we use the Touch Screen interface instead to change settings releasing the relevant GPIO Pins for the TFT screen. I have big fingers so don't make the buttons too small

- All settings which can be changed on the TFT screen.  The Webportal should also availabe as a WiFi access point to configure the WiFi Access credentials
