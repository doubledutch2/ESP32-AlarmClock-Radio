1) Instead of press-buttons, can we use the Touch Screen interface instead to change settings releasing the relevant GPIO Pins for the TFT screen. I have big fingers so don't make the buttons too small

2) Can you update the web interface to include functionality (in a menu driven system using multiple pages) to:

Add up to 10 different Streaming URLs
Configure your timezone and dailight savings settings
Set up to two different alarm times either once, daily, weekdays or weekends with the ability to switch them off/on
All settings which can be changed on the TFT screen

The Webportal should also availabe as a WiFi access point to configure the WiFi Access credentials

3) I understand the ESP32-audioI2S library supports the same functionality as the one we currently use but supports stereo output. If you agree, can you update this project to use that library instead
